## Interface

### AgentSystem — new constructor
```cpp
// Original (unchanged, for backward compat)
AgentSystem(IGridSystem& grid, EventBus& bus);

// New overload — elevator support
AgentSystem(IGridSystem& grid, EventBus& bus, ITransportSystem& transport);
```

### AgentSystem — new private member
```cpp
ITransportSystem* transport_;   // nullptr = same-floor only (backward compat)
```

### AgentSystem — new private method
```cpp
void processElevator(entt::registry& reg, EntityId id,
                     AgentComponent& agent,
                     const AgentScheduleComponent& schedule,
                     const GameTime& time);
```

## Key Behaviors

### Multi-floor travel flow
1. `processSchedule()` detects state change (Idle→Working or Working→Idle/Resting→Working).
2. If `transport_ != nullptr` and `destFloor != currentFloor`:
   - Sets `agent.state = WaitingElevator`
   - Attaches `ElevatorPassengerComponent{targetFloor, waiting=true}`
   - Calls `transport_->callElevator(0, currentFloor, direction)`
3. `update()` routes `WaitingElevator` and `InElevator` agents to `processElevator()`.
4. `processElevator()`:
   - **Waiting**: polls `getElevatorsAtFloor(currentFloor)`, boards if `state == Boarding`
   - **InElevator**: polls `getAllElevators()`, exits if `currentFloor == targetFloor && (DoorOpening || Boarding)`
   - On exit: updates `PositionComponent.tile.floor`, removes `ElevatorPassengerComponent`, sets state to `Working`
5. Work-end cleanup: if `time.hour >= workEndHour` while in elevator → force `Idle`, remove component

### Backward compatibility
- `AgentSystem(IGridSystem&, EventBus&)` sets `transport_ = nullptr`
- When `transport_ == nullptr`, same-floor-only behavior unchanged (existing tests unaffected)

### TransportSystem bugfix
- Added same-floor hall call handling in `tickCar()` Idle state, matching existing `DoorClosing` pattern
- When elevator already at floor of hall call: immediately transitions to `DoorOpening`
- No existing tests broken (none tested same-floor call from Idle)

| # | Test Name | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | NPC floor 0, workplace floor 2 → WaitingElevator at 9am | ✅ Pass |
| 2 | WaitingElevator NPC boards elevator in Boarding state | ✅ Pass |

## Deviations from Spec

1. **`InElevator` state used instead of staying `WaitingElevator`**: Spec says set `waiting=false` in `ElevatorPassengerComponent` and keep `WaitingElevator` state while on board. Implementation uses distinct `InElevator` state for clarity — makes `update()` routing and test assertions cleaner. The `InElevator` state was already defined in the `AgentState` enum.

2. **`shaftX = 0` hardcoded**: As specified in Phase 1. Only one shaft is assumed.

3. **`processSchedule()` refactored**: The original `processSchedule()` only set `agent.state`. Now it also determines `destTenant` to check if floor change is needed. Logic is otherwise equivalent for same-floor cases.

4. **TransportSystem same-floor bugfix**: Not in spec but necessary for correctness. The elevator was stuck `Idle` when the NPC called `callElevator(0, currentFloor, dir)` and the elevator was already at that floor. The `DoorClosing` state already had this pattern — added the same to `Idle`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### TransportSystem Idle state ignoring same-floor hall calls
- **Symptom**: `callElevator(shaftX=0, floor=0, Up)` with elevator already at floor 0 → elevator stays Idle forever, NPC stuck in WaitingElevator
- **Root cause**: `lookNextTarget()` filters out `f == currentFloor` in the `opposite` bucket and never adds same-floor to `sameDir`. The Idle state path reaches `if (next == -1) break` without opening doors.
- **Fix**: Added same-floor check before `lookNextTarget()` call in Idle state, mirroring existing `DoorClosing` pattern.

### Test tick counting for elevator travel
- Initial tests used fixed tick counts to drive elevator from floor 0 to floor 2. The FSM sequence (DoorOpening → Boarding(3 ticks) → DoorClosing → MovingUp(2 ticks) → DoorOpening) requires ~7 ticks minimum.
- Fixed by using a polling loop (`for 0..15 ticks, check if atTarget`) for robustness against config changes.

---

## Open Items

- **P2**: `shaftX = 0` hardcoded. Phase 2 should resolve nearest shaft from NPC position using `GridSystem.isElevatorShaft()`.
- ~~**P2**: Return-home path (Idle after workEnd) also needs elevator logic when homeTenant is on different floor than current position.~~ **Fixed in Post-Review Fix** (see below).
- **P2**: `lunchHour → Resting` transition doesn't check floor; NPC at workplace may want to go to a restaurant on another floor. Out of scope for Phase 1.
- ~~**P3**: NPC stuck in `InElevator` if elevator breaks (e.g., removed mid-ride). No graceful recovery path yet.~~ Partially addressed: phantom agent issue fixed for workEndHour case.

## Post-Review Fix (2026-03-25)

### Issues Fixed

#### Issue 1: Return-home elevator travel missing (3-model consensus P1)
**Problem**: NPCs used the elevator only for outbound trips (home→work). At `workEndHour`, NPCs on a different floor from home transitioned directly to `Idle` without elevator travel, leaving them stranded on the work floor.

**Root cause**: `processSchedule()` already correctly resolved `homeTenant` destination and called `callElevator()` for the return trip. However, `processElevator()` had an early-return that forced any NPC in `WaitingElevator` or `InElevator` to `Idle` when `time.hour >= workEndHour` — this killed the home-bound elevator trip immediately.

**Fix in `src/domain/AgentSystem.cpp` `processElevator()`**:
- When `workEndHour` is reached and the NPC is in `WaitingElevator`:
  - If `targetFloor == homeFloor` (going home): allow elevator trip to continue (do not abort).
  - If `targetFloor != homeFloor` (going to work): abort and transition to `Idle` (old behavior).
- When `workEndHour` is reached and the NPC is `InElevator` (on board):
  - Do NOT force `Idle` immediately.
  - If elevator is at home floor: exit and transition to `Idle`.
  - Otherwise: re-route `targetFloor` to home floor and let normal exit logic handle arrival.

#### Issue 2: Phantom agent when work ends while InElevator (Gemini P1)
**Problem**: When `workEndHour` was reached while InElevator, the old code forced `Idle` and removed `ElevatorPassengerComponent` — but did NOT call `exitPassenger()` if the elevator was at a non-target floor, leaving a ghost passenger in the TransportSystem.

**Fix in `src/domain/AgentSystem.cpp` `processElevator()`**:
- Changed `targetFloor` to `homeDest.floor` instead of forcing Idle.
- The NPC rides the elevator to the home floor and exits normally via the standard exit logic, which calls `exitPassenger()` correctly.

### Test Changes

| # | Test Name | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | NPC re-routes to home when workEndHour reached during elevator | **Updated** — now verifies re-route behavior instead of forced Idle |
| 11 | NPC at floor 2 at workEndHour → WaitingElevator when home is floor 0 | **New** — verifies return-home elevator call |
| 12 | NPC re-routes to home floor when workEndHour while InElevator | **New** — verifies phantom agent fix |
| 13 | NPC arrives at home floor via elevator and transitions to Idle | **New** — full round-trip test |

### Test Results
- **187/187 tests passed** (184 existing + 3 new)
- No interface headers (I*.h) modified
